The `LinkedList` class should run on any MRR or version of Ruby with RSpec gem.

To execute:
-----------
```
$> rspec linked_list.rb

LinkedList
  has a head
  has a tail
  adds a value
  finds a node
  removes a node

Finished in 0.00351 seconds (files took 0.16092 seconds to load)
5 examples, 0 failures
```

Complete the LinkedList class to make the specs pass. 

- Add any additional classes if required
- Add any additional tests if required
- Bonus if you can add a `reverse` method to `LinkedList`
